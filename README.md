# convert-toImage
convert your image to PNG, JPG and WEBP.
## Editing code!.
You can only convert 2 images per attempt, doing so with 3 images caused me several issues.  
You could add an "ico" option, I didn't do it because I found it too difficult **(I'm just a student).**  
The images are saved in _sessionStorage_  
### **Thanks for reading :D!.**
